Verona. A Public Place. \\n\\nEnter Sampson and Gregory, of the house of Capidet, \\nwith sivords and bucklers. \\n\\nSampson. Gregory, on my word, we\\'ll not carry coals. \\n\\nGregory. No, for then we should be colliers. \\n\\nSampson. I mean, an we be in choler, we\\'ll draw. \\n\\nGregory. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o\\' \\nthe collar. \\n\\nSam.pson. I strike quickly, being moved. \\n\\nGregory. But thou art not quickly moved to strike. \\n\\nSampson. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. \\n\\nGregory. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to \\nstand ; therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn\\'st away. \\n\\nSampson. A dog of that house shall move me to stand; \\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague\\'s. \\n\\nGregory. That shows thee a weak slave ; for the weak- \\nest goes to the wall. \\n\\nSampson. True; and therefore women, being the weaker \\nvessels, are ever thrust to the wall : therefore I will push \\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n\\n10 BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nMontague\\'s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to \\nthe wall. \\n\\nGregory. The quarrel is between our masters and us \\ntheir men. \\n\\nSampson. \\'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant ; \\nwhen I have fought with the men, I will be cruel with \\nthe maids, and cut oif their heads. \\n\\nGregory. Draw thy tool ; here comes two of the house \\nof the Montagues. \\n\\nSampson. My naked weapon is out; quarrel, I will \\nback thee. \\n\\nGregory. How ? turn thy back and run ? \\n\\nSampson. Fear me not. \\n\\nGregory. No, marry ; I fear thee ! \\n\\nSampson. Let us take the law of our sides ; let them \\nbegin. \\n\\nGregory. T will frown as I pass by, and let them take \\nit as they list. \\n\\nSampson. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb \\nat them ; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it. \\n\\nEnter Abram and Balthasak. \\n\\nAbram. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir ? \\nSampson. I do bite my thumb, sir. \\nAbram. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir ? \\nSampson. [Aside to Gregory\"] Is the law of our side if \\nI say ay ? \\n\\n\\n\\nEOMEO AND JULIET. H \\n\\nGregory. No. \\n\\nSampson. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, \\nbut I bite my thumb, sir. \\n\\nGregory. Do you quarrel, sir ? \\n\\nAbram. Quarrel, sir ! no, sir. \\n\\nSampson. If you do, sir, I am for you ; I serve as good \\na man as you. \\n\\nAbram. No better. \\n\\nSampson. Well, sir. \\n\\nGregory. [^Aside to Sampson^ Say \"better;\" here comes \\none of my master\\'s kinsmen. \\n\\nSampson. Yes, better, sir. \\n\\nAbram. You lie. \\n\\nSampson. Draw, if you be men. — Gregory, remember \\nthy swashing blow. ■ \\\\_They fight. \\n\\nEnter Benvolio. \\n\\nBenvoUo. Part, fools ! \\nPut up your swords ; you know not what you do. \\n\\n[Beats down their swords. \\n\\nEnter Tybalt. \\n\\nTybalt. What, art thou drawn among these heartless \\nhinds ? \\nTurn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death. \\n\\nBenvolio. I do but keep the peace ; put up thy sword, \\nOr manage it to part these men with me. \\n\\n\\n\\n12 BOjIEO and JULIET. \\n\\nTybalt. What, drawn, and talk of peace ! I hate the \\n\"word, \\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee ; \\nHave at thee, coward ! \\\\_Tliey fight. \\n\\nEnter several of both houses, who join the fray; then \\nenter Citizens, with clubs. \\n\\nFirst Citizen. Clubs, bills, and partisans ! strike ! beat \\nthem down ! \\nDown with the Capulets ! down with the Montagues ! \\n\\nEnter Capulet in his gotvn, and Lady Capulet. \\n\\nCapulet. What noise is this ? Give nie my long \\n\\nsword, ho ! \\nLady Caindet. A crutch, a crutch ! why call you for \\n\\na sword ? \\nCaindet. My sword, I say ! Old Montague is come. \\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me. \\n\\nEnter Montague and Lady Montague. \\n\\n2Iontacjue. Thou villain Capulet! — Hold me not, le^. \\n\\nme go. \\nLady Montague. Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a \\n\\nfoe. \\n\\nEnter Prince, tvith his train. \\n\\nPrince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace, \\nProfaners of this neighbor-stained steel, — \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 13 \\n\\nWill they not hear ? What, ho ! you men, you beasts, \\n\\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage \\n\\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins, \\n\\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands \\n\\nThrow your mistemper\\'d weapons to the ground, \\n\\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince. — \\n\\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word. \\n\\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague, \\n\\nHave thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets, \\n\\nAnd made Verona\\'s ancient citizens \\n\\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments. \\n\\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old, \\n\\nCanker\\'d with peace, to part your canker\\'d hate. \\n\\nIf ever you disturb our streets again. \\n\\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. \\n\\nFor this time, all the rest depart away : \\n\\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me ; \\n\\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon, \\n\\nTo know our further pleasure in this case, \\n\\nTo old Freetown, our common judgment-place. \\n\\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart. \\n\\n^Exeunt all but Montague, Lady 3Iontague, and Benvolio. \\n\\nMontague. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach ? \\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began ? \\n\\nBenvolio. Here were the servants of your adversary \\nAnd yours close fighting ere I did approach. \\nI drew to part them : in the instant came \\n\\n\\n\\n14- BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar\\'d ; \\nWhich, as he breath\\'d defiance to my ears, \\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds, \\nWho, nothing hurt withal, hiss\\'d him in scorn. \\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows. \\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part. \\nTill the prince came, who parted either part. \\n\\nLady Montague. 0, where is Eomeo ? saw you him \\nto-day ? \\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray. \\n\\nBenvolio. Madam, an hour before the worshipp\\'d sun \\nPeer\\'d forth the golden window of the east, \\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad ; \\nWhere, underneath the grove of sycamore \\nThat westward rooteth from the city\\'s side. \\nSo early walking did I see your son. \\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me \\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood ; \\nI, measuring his affections by my own. \\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found, \\nBeing one too many by my weary self, \\nPursued my humor not pursuing his. \\nAnd gladly shunn\\'d who gladly fled from me. \\n\\nMontague. Many a morning hath he there been seen \\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew, \\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs ; \\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 15 \\n\\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw \\nThe shady curtains from Aurora\\'s bea, \\nAway from light steals home my heavy son, \\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself, \\nShuts up his window, locks fair daylight out, \\nAnd makes himself an ar|;ificial night. \\nBlack and portentous must this humor prove. \\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove. \\n\\nBenvolio. My noble uncle, do you know the cause ? \\n\\nMontague. I neither know it nor can learn of him. \\n\\nBenvolio. Have you importun\\'d him by any means ? \\n\\nMontague. Both by myself and many other friends ; \\nBut he, his own affections\\' counsellor. \\nIs to himself — I will not say how true — \\nBut to himself so secret and sd close, \\nSo far from sounding and discovery. \\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm, \\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, \\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun. \\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow \\nWe would as willingly give cure as know. \\n\\nEnter Eomeo. \\n\\nBenvolio. See, where he comes : so please you, step \\naside ; \\nI\\'ll know his grievance, or be much deniea. \\n\\n\\n\\n15\\' BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nMontague. I would tliou wert so happy by tliy stay, \\nTo hear true slirif t. — Come, madam, let\\'s away. \\n\\n[^Exeunt Montague and Lady. \\n\\nBenvolio. Good morrow, cousin. \\n\\nRomeo. Is the day so young ? \\n\\nBenvolio. But new struck nine. \\n\\nRomeo. Ay me ! sad hours seem long. \\n\\nWas that my father that went hence so fast ? \\n\\nBenvolio. It was. What sadness lengthens Borneo\\'s \\nhours ? \\n\\nRomeo. Not having that which, having, makes them \\nshort. \\n\\nBenvolio. In love ? \\n\\nRomeo. Out — \\n\\nBenvolio. Of love ? \\n\\nRomeo. Out of her favor, where I am in love. \\n\\nBenvolio. Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, \\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof ! \\n\\nRomeo. Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, \\nShould without eyes see pathways to his will ! \\nWhere si: all we dine ? — O me ! what fray was here ? \\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all. \\nHere\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love. \\nWhy, then, brawling love ! loving hate ! \\nO anything, of nothing first created ! \\nheavy lightness ! serious vanity ! \\nIMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms \\' \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 17 \\n\\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health ! \\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is ! \\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this. \\nDost thou not laugh ? \\n\\nBenvolw, No, coz, I rather weep. \\n\\nRomeo. Good heart, at what ? \\n\\nBenvolio. At thy good heart\\'s oppression. \\n\\nRomeo. Why, such is love\\'s transgression. \\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, \\nWhich thou wilt propagate, to have it prest \\nWith more of thine ; this love that thou hast shown \\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own. \\nLove is a smoke rais\\'d with the fume of sighs : \\nBeing purg\\'d, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes ; \\nBeing vex\\'d, a sea nourish\\'d with lovers\\' tears ; \\nWhat is it else ? a madness most discreet, \\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet. \\nFarewell, my coz. \\n\\nBenvolio. Soft ! I will go along ; \\n\\nAn if you leave me so, you do me wrong. \\n\\nRomeo. Tut, I have lost myself ; I am not here : \\nThis is not Romeo, he\\'s some other where. \\n\\nBenvolio. Tell me in sadness who is that you love. \\n\\nRomeo. What, shall I groan and tell thee ? \\n\\nBenvolio. Groan ! why, no ; \\n\\nBut sadly tell me who. \\n\\nRomeo. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will; \\n\\n\\n\\n18 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nAh, word ill urg\\'d to one that is so ill ! \\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman. \\n\\nBenvolio. I aini\\'d so near when I suppos\\'d you lov\\'d. \\n\\nRomeo. A right good mark-man ! And she\\'s fair I love. \\n\\nBenvolio. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. \\n\\nRomeo. Well, in that hit you miss : she\\'ll not be hit \\nWith Cupid\\'s arrow ; she hath Dian\\'s wit. \\nAnd, in strong proof of chastity well arm\\'d, \\nFrom love\\'s weak childish bow she lives unharm\\'d. \\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms. \\nNor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, \\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold ; \\n0, she is rich in beauty ! only poor \\nThat, when she dies, with beauty dies her store. \\n\\nBenvolio. Then she hath sworn that she will still live \\nchaste ? \\n\\nRomeo. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge \\nwaste ; \\nFor beauty starv\\'d with her severity \\nCuts beauty off from all prosperity. \\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, \\nTo merit bliss by making me despair ; \\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow \\nDo I live dead that live to tell it now. \\n\\nBenvolio. Be rul\\'d by me, forget to think of her. \\n\\nRomeo. 0, teach me how I should forget to think. \\n\\nBenvolio. By giving liberty unto thine eyes ; \\nExamine other beauties. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. ig \\n\\nRomeo. \\'Tis the way \\n\\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more. \\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies\\' brows, \\nBeing black, put us in mind they hide the fair; \\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget \\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost. \\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair. \\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note \\nWhere I may read who pass\\'d that passing fair ? \\nFarewell ; thou canst not teach me to forget. \\n\\nBenvolio. I\\'ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. \\n\\n[Exeunt^ \\n\\nScene II. A Street. \\nEnter Capulet, Paris, and Servant. \\n\\nCapulet. But Montague is bound as well as I, \\nIn penalty alike ; and \\'tis not hard, I think, \\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace. \\n\\nParis. Of honorable reckoning are you both ; \\nAnd pity \\'tis you liv\\'d at odds so long. \\nBut now, my lord, what say you to my suit ? \\n\\nCapulet. But saying o\\'er what I have said before, \\n^ly child is yet a stranger in the world ; \\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years : \\nLet two more summers wither in their pride, \\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride. \\n\\n\\n\\n20 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nParis. Younger than she are happy mothers made. \\n\\nCapidet. And too soon marr\\'d are those so early made. \\nThe earth has swallow\\'d all my hopes but she, \\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth : \\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart, \\nMy will to her consent is but a part ; \\nAn she agree, within her scope of choice \\nLies my consent and fair according voice. \\nThis night I hold an old accustom\\'d feast, \\nWhereto I have invited many a guest, \\nSuch as I love ; and you, among the store, \\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more. \\nAt my poor house look to behold this night \\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light : \\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel \\nWhen well-apparell\\'d April on the heel \\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight \\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night \\nInherit at my house ; hear all, all see. \\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be : \\nWhich on more view of many, mine being one \\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none. \\nCome, go with me. — \\\\_To servant, giving a 2^(^P&i^\\'\\\\ GrO, \\n\\nsirrah, trudge about \\nThrough fair VeroUa ; find those persons out, \\nWhose names are Avritten there, and to them say. \\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay. \\n\\n\\\\_Exeunt Caindet and Paris. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 21 \\n\\nServant. Find them out whose names are written here ! \\nIt is written that the shoemaker shouhl meddle with his \\nyard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his \\npencil and the painter with his nets ; but I am sent to \\nfind those persons whose names are here writ, and can \\nnever find what names the writing person hath here Avrit. \\nI must to the learned. — In good time. \\n\\nEnter Benvolio and Romeo. \\nBenvol\\'io. Tut, man, one fire burns out another\\'s burn- \\n\\nOne pain is lessen\\'d by another\\'s anguish ; \\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning ; \\n\\nOne desperate grief cures with another\\'s languish : \\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye. \\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die. \\n\\nRomeo. Your plantain-leaf is excellent for that. \\n\\nBenvolio. For what, I pray thee ? \\n\\nRomeo. For your broken shin. \\n\\nBenvolio. Why, Romeo, art thou mad ? \\n\\nRomeo. ISTot mad, but bound more than a madman is ; \\nShut up in prison, kept without my food, \\nWhipp\\'d and tormented and — Good-den, good fellow. \\n\\nServant. God gi\\' good-den. — I pray, sir, can you read? \\n\\nRomeo. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery. \\n\\nServant. Perhaps you have learned it without book ; \\nbut, I pray, can you read anything you see ? \\n\\n\\n\\n22 EOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nBorneo. Ay, if I know the letters and the language. \\n\\nServant. Ye say honestly ; rest you merry ! \\n\\nRomeo. Stay, fellow ; I can read. \\n\\n[Reads] \\' Sipiior Martino and his wife and daughter; \\nCounty Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; the lady widow \\nof Vitruvio ; Slgnior Placentio and his lovely nieces ; \\nMercutio and his brother Valentine ; mine uncle Capulet, \\nhis wife, and daughters ; my fair niece Rosaline ; Livia ; \\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt; Lucio and the \\nlively Helena.\\' \\nA fair assembly ; whither should they come ? \\n\\nServant. Up. \\n\\nRomeo. Whither ? \\n\\nServant. To supper ; to our house. \\n\\nRomeo. Whose house ? \\n\\nServant. My master\\'s. \\n\\nRomeo. Indeed, I should have ask\\'d you that before. \\n\\nServant. Now I\\'ll tell you without asking : my master \\nis the great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house \\nof Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine. \\nRest you merry ! \\\\_Exit. \\n\\nBenvolio. At this same ancient feast of Capulet\\'s \\nSups the fair Rosaline, whom thou so lov\\'st, \\nWith all the admired beauties of Verona. \\nGo thither, and with unattainted eye \\nCompare her face with some that I shall show. \\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow. \\n\\n\\n\\nEOMEO AND JULIET. 23 \\n\\nBorneo. When the devout religion of mine eye \\n\\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires ; \\nAnd these, who often drown\\'d could never die, \\n\\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars ! \\nOne fairer than my love ! the all-seeing sun \\nNe\\'er saw her match since first the world begun. \\n\\nBenvolio. Tut ! you saw her fair, none else being by, \\nHerself pois\\'d with herself in either eye ; \\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weigh\\'d \\nYour lady\\'s love against some other maid \\nThat I will show you shining at this feast. \\nAnd she shall scant show well that now shows best. \\n\\nRomeo. I\\'ll go along, no such sight to be shown. \\nBut to rejoice in splendor of mine own. \\\\Exeunt. \\n\\nScene III. A Boom in Cajpulefs House. \\nEnter Lady Capulet and Kurse. \\n\\nLady Capulet. Kurse, where\\'s my daughter ? call her \\nforth to me. \\n\\nNurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old, \\nI bade her come. — What, lamb ! what, lady -bird ! — \\nGod forbid ! —Where\\'s this girl ?— What, Juliet ! \\n\\nEnter Juliet. \\n\\nJuliet.

I\\'ll lay fourteen of m.j teeth, — \\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four, — \\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now \\nTo Lammas-tide ? \\n\\nLady Capulet. A fortnight and odd days. \\n\\nNurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, \\nCome Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen. \\nSusan and she — God rest all Christian souls ! — \\nWere of an age : well, Susan is with God ; \\nShe was too good for me : but, as I said, \\nOn Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen ; \\nThat shall she, marry ; I remember it well. \\n\\'Tis since the earthquake noAv eleven years ; \\nAnd she was wean\\'d, — I never shall forget it, — \\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day : \\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug, \\nSitting in the sun under the dove-house wall ; \\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua. — \\n\\n\\n\\nEOMEO AND JULIET. 25 \\n\\nKay, I do bear a brain : — but, as I said, \\n\\nWhen it did taste tlie wormwood on the nipple \\n\\nOf my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool. \\n\\nTo see it tetchy and fall out with the dug ! \\n\\nShake, quoth the dove-house ; \\'twas no need, I trow, \\n\\nTo bid me trudge. \\n\\nAnd since that time it is eleven years ; \\n\\nFor then she could stand alone ; nay, by the rood, \\n\\nShe could have run and waddled all about. — \\n\\nGod mark thee to his grace ! \\n\\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e\\'er I nurs\\'d ; \\n\\nAn I might live to see thee married once, \\n\\nI have my wish. \\n\\nLady Capulet. Marry, that \\' marry \\' is the very theme \\nI came to talk of. — Tell me, daughter Juliet, \\nHow stands your disposition to be married ? \\n\\nJuliet. It is an honor that I dream not of. \\n\\nNurse. An honor ! were not I thine only nurse, \\nI would say thou hadst suek\\'d wisdom from thy teat. \\n\\nLady Capulet. Well, think of marriage now ; younger \\nthan you \\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem, \\nAre made already mothers : by my count, \\nI was your mother much upon these years \\nThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief : \\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love. \\n\\nJSfurse. A man, young lady ! lady, such a man \\nAs all the world — why, he\\'s a man of wax. \\n\\n\\n\\n26 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nLady Capulet. Verona\\'s summer hath not such a flower. \\n\\nNurse. Nay, he\\'s a flower ; in faith, a very flower. \\n\\nLady Capulet. What say you ? can you love the gen- \\ntleman ? \\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast ; \\nRead o\\'er the volume of young Paris\\' face, \\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty\\'s pen; \\nExamine every married lineament \\nAnd see how one another lends content, \\nA.nd what obscur\\'d in this fair volume lies \\nFind written in the margent of his eyes. \\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover, \\nTo beautify him, only lacks a cover ; \\nThe fish lives in the sea, and \\'tis much pride \\nFor fair without the fair within to hide. \\nThat book in many\\'s eyes doth share the glory, \\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story ; \\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess. \\nBy having him making yourself no less. \\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris\\' love ? \\n\\nJuliet. I\\'ll look to like, if looking liking move ; \\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye \\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly. \\n\\nEnter a Servant. \\n\\nServant.

What, shall this speech be spoke for our ex- \\ncuse ? \\nOr shall we on without apology ? \\n\\nBenvolio. The date is out of such prolixity. \\nWe\\'ll have no Cupid hoodwink\\'d with a scarf, \\nBearing a Tartar\\'s painted bow of lath, \\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper ; \\nNor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke \\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance : \\nBut let them measure us by what they will, \\nWe\\'ll measure them a measure, and be gone. \\n\\nRomeo. Give me a torch ; I am not for this ambling : \\nBeing but heavy, I will bear the light. \\n\\nMercutio. Nay, gentle Romeo, Ave must have you dance. \\n\\nRomeo. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes \\nWith nimble soles ; I have a soul of lead \\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move. \\n\\n\\n\\n28 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nMercutio. You are a lover ; borrow Cupid\\'s wings, \\nAnd soar with them above a common bound. \\n\\nRomeo. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft \\nTo soar Avith his light feathers, and, so bound, \\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe ; \\nUnder love\\'s heavy burden do I sink. \\n\\nMercutio. And, to sink in it, should you burden love ; \\nToo great oppression for a tender thing. \\n\\nRomeo. Is love a tender thing ? it is too rough, \\nToo rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn. \\n\\nMercutio. If love be rough with you, be rough with \\nlove; \\nPrick love for pricking, and jovi beat love down. — \\nGive me a case to put my visage in ; \\n\\n\\\\_Putting on a mask. \\nA visor for a visor ! what care I \\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities ? \\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me. \\n\\nBenvolio. Come, knock and enter ; and no sooner in, \\nBut every man betake him to his legs. \\n\\nRomeo. A torch for me ; let wantons light of heart \\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels, \\nFor I am proverb\\'d with a grandsire phrase : \\nI\\'ll be a candle-holder, and look on. \\nThe game was ne\\'er so fair, and I am done. \\n\\nMercutio. Tut, dun\\'s the mouse, the constable\\'s own \\nword: \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 29 \\n\\nIf thou art Dun, we\\'ll draw thee from the mire \\nOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick\\'st \\nUp to the ears. — Come, we burn daylight, ho ! \\n\\nRomeo. Nay, that\\'s not so. \\n\\nMercutio. I mean, sir, in delay \\n\\nWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day. \\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits \\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits. \\n\\nBorneo. And we mean well in going to this mask ; \\nBut \\'tis no wit to go. \\n\\nMercutio. Why, may one ask ? \\n\\nBorneo. I dreamt a dream to-night. \\n\\nMercutio. ^nd so did I. \\n\\nRomeo. Well, what was yours ? \\n\\nMercutio. That dreamers often lie. \\n\\nRovieo. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. \\n\\nMercutio. O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with \\nyou. \\nShe is the fairies\\' midwife, and she comes \\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone \\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman, \\nDrawn with a team of little atomies \\nAthwart men\\'s noses as they lie asleep ; \\nHer wagon-spokes made of long spinners\\' legs, \\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers. \\nThe traces of the smallest spider\\'s web. \\nThe collars of the moonshine\\'s watery beams. \\n\\n\\n\\n30 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nHer whip of cricket\\'s bone, the lash of film, \\n\\nHer wagoner a small gray-coated gnat, \\n\\nNot half so big as a round little worm \\n\\nPrick\\'d from the lazy finger of a maid ; \\n\\nHer chariot is an empty hazel-nnt \\n\\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub, \\n\\nTime out o\\' mind the fairies\\' coach-makers. \\n\\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night \\n\\nThrough lovers\\' brains, and then they dream of love ; \\n\\nO\\'er courtiers\\' knees, that dream on court\\'sies straight ; \\n\\nO\\'er lawyers\\' fingers, who straight dream on fees ; \\n\\nO\\'er ladies\\' lips, who straight on kisses dream. \\n\\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, \\n\\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. \\n\\nSometime she gallops o\\'er a courtier\\'s nose, \\n\\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit. \\n\\nAnd sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig\\'s tail \\n\\nTickling a parson\\'s nose as a\\' lies asleep, \\n\\nThen dreams he of another benefice. \\n\\nSometime she driveth o\\'er a soldier\\'s neck, \\n\\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, \\n\\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades. \\n\\nOf healths five-fatliom deep ; and then anon \\n\\nDrums in his ears, at which he starts and wakes, \\n\\nAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two \\n\\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab \\n\\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night. \\n\\n\\n\\nBOMEO AND JULIET. 31 \\n\\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in fonl sluttish hairs, \\nWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes. \\nThis is she — \\n\\nRomeo. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace ! \\n\\nThou talk\\'st of nothing. \\n\\nMercutio. True, I talk of dreams, \\n\\nWhich are the children of an idle brain, \\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy. \\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air, \\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooes \\nEven now the frozen bosom of the North, \\nAnd, being anger\\'d, puffs away from thence, \\nTurning his face to the dew-dropping South. \\n\\nBenvolio. This wind you talk of blows us from our- \\nselves ; \\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late. \\n\\nRomeo. I fear, too early ; for my mind misgives \\nSome consequence, yet hanging in the stars, \\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date \\nWith this night\\'s revels, and expire the term \\nOf a despised life clos\\'d in my breast \\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death. \\nBut He that hath the steerage of my course \\nDirect my sail ! — On, lusty gentlemen. \\n\\nBenvolio. Strike, drum. \\\\_^Exeunt. \\n\\n\\n\\n32 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nScene V. A Hall in Capidefs House. \\nMusicians tvaiting. Enter Servingmen, ivith napkins. \\n\\n1 Servingman.

Forswear it, sight ! \\nFor I ne\\'er saw true beauty till this night. \\n\\nTijhalt. This, by his voice, should be a Montague. — \\nFetch me my rapier, boy. — What dares the slave \\nCome hither, cover\\'d with an antic face. \\nTo fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? \\nNow, by the stock and honor of my kin, \\nTo strike him dead I hold it not a sin. \\n\\nCiipulet. Why, how now, kinsman ! wherefore storm \\nyou so ? \\n\\nTybalt. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, \\nA villain that is hithex come in spite. \\nTo scorn at our solemnity this night. \\n\\nCtqmlet. Young Romeo, is it ? \\n\\nTybalt. ■ \\'Tis he, that villain Komeo. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 35 \\n\\nCapxdet. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone : \\nHe bears him like a portly gentleman ; \\nAnd, to say truth, Verona brags of him \\nTo be a virtuous and well-govern\\'d youth. \\nI would not for the wealth of all the town \\nHere in my house do him disparagement ; \\nTherefore be patient, take no note of him : \\nIt is my will, the which if thou respect, \\nShow a fair presence and put off these frowns, \\nAn ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. \\n\\nTybalt. It fits, when such a villain is a guest ; \\nI\\'ll not endure him. \\n\\nCapulet. He shall be endur\\'d: \\nWhat, goodman boy ! I say, he shall : go to ; \\nAm I the master here, or you ? go to. \\nYou\\'ll not endure him ! — God shall mend my soul ! — \\nYou\\'ll make a mutiny among my guests ! \\nYou will set cock-a-hoop ! you\\'ll be the man ! \\n\\nTybalt. Why, uncle, \\'tis a shame. \\n\\nCapulet. Go to, go to ; \\n\\nYou are a saucy boy : — is\\'t so, indeed ? — \\nThis trick may chance to scathe you, — I know what. \\nYou must contrary me ! marry, \\'tis time. — \\nWell said, my hearts ! — You are a princox ; go : \\nBe quiet, or — More light, more light ! — For shame ! \\nI\\'ll make you quiet. What ! — Cheerly, my hearts ! \\n\\nTybalt. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting \\n\\n\\n\\n36 EOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. \\n\\nI will withdraw ; but this intrusion shall, \\n\\nNow seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall. [Exit. \\n\\nBorneo. \\\\_To Juliet] If I profane with my un worthiest \\nhand \\n\\nThis holy shrine, the gentle fine is this : \\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand \\n\\nTo smooth that rough touch Avith a tender kiss. \\n\\nJuliet. Good pilgrim, you do Avrong your hand too much, \\n\\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this ; \\nFor saiiits have hands that pilgrims\\' hands do touch, \\n\\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmer\\'s kiss. \\n\\nRomeo. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too ? \\n\\nJuliet. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. \\n\\nRomeo. 0, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do ; \\nThey pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. \\n\\nJuliet. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers\\' \\nsake. \\n\\nRomeo.

An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him. \\n\\nMercutio. This cannot anger him : \\'twould anger him \\nTo raise a spirit in his mistress\\' circle \\nOf some strange nature, letting it there stand \\nTill she had laid it and conjur\\'d it down ; \\nThat were some spite : my invocation \\nIs fair and honest, and in his mistress\\' name \\nT conjure only but to raise up him. \\n\\nBenvolio. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees. \\nTo be consorted with the humorous night ; \\nBlind is his love and best befits the dark, \\n\\nMercutio. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. — \\nRomeo, good night. — I\\'ll to my truckle bed; \\nThis field-bed is too cold for me to sleep. \\nCome, shall we go ? \\n\\nBenvolio.

By a name \\n\\nI know not how to tell thee who I am. \\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, \\nBecause it is an enemy to thee ; \\nHad I it written, I would tear the word. \\n\\nJuliet. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words \\nOf that tongue\\'s utterance, yet I know the sound. — \\nArt thou not Eomeo, and a Montague ? \\n\\nRomeo. Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. \\n\\nJuliet. How cam\\'st thou hither, tell me, and where- \\nfore ? \\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb. \\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art. \\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here. \\n\\nRomeo. With love\\'s light wings did I o\\'er-perch these \\nwalls, \\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out, \\nAnd what love can do that dares love attempt ; \\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me. \\n\\nJuliet. If they do see thee, they will murder thee. \\n\\nRomeo. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye \\nThan twenty of their swords ; look thou but sweet. \\nAnd I am proof against their enmity. \\n\\nJuliet. I would not for the world they saw thee here. \\n\\n\\n\\n44 , EOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nRomeo. I have night\\'s cloak to hide me from their \\neyes ; \\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here : \\nMy life were better ended by their hate, \\nThan death prorogued, Avanting of thy love. \\n\\nJuliet. By whose direction found\\'st thou out this place ? \\n\\nRomeo.

I pray thee, chide not : she whom I love now \\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow ; \\nThe other did not so. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. O, she knew well, \\nThy love did read by rote and could not spell. \\nBut come, young waverer, come, go with me, \\nIn one respect I\\'ll thy assistant be ; \\nFor this alliance may so happy prove, \\nTo turn your households\\' rancor to pure love. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 53 \\n\\nBorneo. 0, let us hence, I stand, on sudden haste. \\nFriar Laurence.

Why, that same pale hard-hearted, wench, \\nthat Rosaline, \\nTorments him so that he will sure run mad. \\n\\nBenvolio. Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, \\nHath sent a letter to his father\\'s house. \\n\\nMercutio. A challenge, on my life. \\n\\nBenvolio. Romeo will answer it. \\n\\nMercutio. Any man that can write may answer a letter. \\n\\nBenvolio. Nay, he will answer the letter\\'s master, how \\nhe dares, being dared. \\n\\nMercutio. Alas, poor Romeo ! he is already dead ; \\nstabbed with a white wench\\'s black eye ; shot through \\nthe ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft \\nwith the blind bow-boy\\'s butt-shaft : and is he a man to \\nencounter Tybalt ? \\n\\nBenvolio.

The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive ? \\n\\nBorneo. Pardon, good Mercutio, rny business was great ; \\nand in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy. \\n\\nMercutio. That\\'s as much as to say, such a case as \\nyours constrains a man to bow in the hams. \\n\\nRomeo. Meaning, to courtesy. \\n\\nMercutio. Thou hast most kindly hit it. \\n\\nRomeo. A most courteous exposition. \\n\\nMercutio. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. \\n\\nRomeo. Pink for flower. \\n\\nMerevtlo. Kight. \\n\\nRomeo. Why, then is my pump well flowered. \\n\\nMercutio. Well said ; follow me this jest now till thou \\nhast worn out thy pumjj, that when the single sole of it is \\nworn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular. \\n\\nRomeo. single-soled jest, solely singular for the sin- \\ngleness. \\n\\nMercutio. Come between us, good Benvolio ; my wits \\nfail. \\n\\nRomeo. Switch and spurs, switch and spurs ; or I\\'ll \\ncry a match. \\n\\nMercutio. Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I \\nhave done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one \\nof thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five. \\nWas T with you there for the goose ? \\n\\n\\n\\n56 BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nRomeo. Thou wast never with me for anything when \\nthou wast not there for the goose. \\n\\nMercutio. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest. \\n\\nRomeo. Nay, good goose, bite not. \\n\\nMercutio. Thy wit is ^ very bitter sweeting; it is a \\nmost sharp sauce. \\n\\nRomeo. And is it not well served in to a sweet goose ? \\n\\nIlerctitio. 0, here\\'s a wit of cheveril, that stretches \\nfrom an inch narrow to an ell broad ! \\n\\nRomeo. I stretch it out for that word \\' broad ; \\' which \\nadded to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad \\ngoose. \\n\\nMercutio. Why, is not this better now than groaning \\nfor love ? now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo ; \\nnow art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature : \\nfor this drivelling love is like a great natural, — \\n\\nBenvolio.

By my troth, it is well said; \\'for himself to \\nmar,\\' quoth a\\' ? — Gentlemen, can any of you tell me \\nwhere I may find the young Romeo ? \\n\\nRomeo. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be \\nolder when you have found him than he was when you \\nsought him. I am the youngest of that name, for fault \\nof a worse. \\n\\nNurse. You say well. \\n\\nMercutio. Yea, is the worst well ? very well took, i\\' \\nfaith ; wisely, wisely. \\n\\nNurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with \\nyou. \\n\\nBenvolio.

So smi]e the heavens upon this holy \\nact \\nThat after hours with sorrow chide us not ! \\n\\nRomeo. Amen, amen ! but come what sorrow can, \\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy \\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight. \\nDo thou hut close our hands with holy words, \\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare, \\nIt is enough I may but call her mine. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. These violent delights have violent \\nends, \\nAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder. \\nWhich as they kiss consume • the sweetest honey \\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness. \\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite. \\nTherefore love moderately ; long love doth so : \\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow. \\n\\nEnter Juliet. \\n\\nHere comes the lady. 0, so light a foot \\nWill ne\\'er wear out the everlasting flint ! \\nA lover may bestride the gossamer \\nThat idles in the wanton summer air, \\nAnd yet not fall ; so light is vanity. \\n\\n\\n\\nBOMEO AND JULIET. 65 \\n\\nJuliet. Good even to my ghostly confessor. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Komeo shall thank thee, daughter, \\nfor us both. \\n\\nJuliet. As much to him, else is his thanks too much, \\n\\nRomeo. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy \\nBe heap\\'d like mine and that thy skill De more \\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath \\nThis neighbor air, and let rich music\\'s tongue \\nUnfold the imagin\\'d happiness that both \\nEeceive in either by this dear encounter. \\n\\nJuliet. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words, \\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament. \\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth ; \\nBut my true love is grown to such excess \\nI cannot sum up half my sum of wealth. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Come, come with me, and we will make \\nshort work ; \\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone \\nTill holy church incorporate two in one. [_Exeimt. \\n\\n\\n\\nACT III. \\n\\nScene I. A Public Place. \\n\\nEnter Mekcutio, Benvolio, Page, and Servants. \\n\\nBenvolio. I pi-ay thee, good Merciitio, let\\'s retire : \\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad, \\nAnd if we meet we shall not scape a brawl ; \\nFor now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. \\n\\nMercutio. Thou art like one of tliose fellows that when \\nhe enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword \\nupon the table, and says \\'God send me no need of thee!\\' \\nand by the operation of the second cup draws hiui on the \\ndrawer, when. ind^ed^there is no need. \\n\\nBenvolio. Am I like such a fellow ? \\n\\nMercutio. Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy \\nmood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, \\nand as soon moody to be moved. \\n\\nBenvolio. And what to ? \\n\\nMercutio. Nay, an there were two such, we should \\nhave none shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou ! \\nwhy, thou wilt quarrel with a num that hath a hair \\nmore, or a hair less, in his beard than thou hast. Thou \\nwilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, luiving no \\nother reason but because thou hast hazel eyes ; what \\n\\n66 \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 67 \\n\\neye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ? \\nThy head is as full of quarrels as au egg is full of meat, \\nand yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg \\nfor quarrelling. Thou hast quarrelled with a man for \\ncoughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog \\nthat hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out \\nwith a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ? \\nwith another, for tying his new shoes with old riband ? \\nand yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling ! \\n\\nBenvolio. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any \\nman should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour \\nand a quarter. \\n\\nMercutio. The fee-simple ! simj^le ! \\n\\nBenvolio. By my head, here come the Capulets. \\n\\nMercutio. By my heel, I care not. \\n\\nEnter Tybalt and others. \\n\\nTybalt. Follow me close, for I will speak to them. — \\nGentlemen, good den ; a word with one of you. \\n\\nMercutio. And but one word with one of us ? couple \\nit with something, make it a word and a blow. \\n\\nTybalt. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an \\nyou will give me occasion. \\n\\nMercutio. Could you not take some occasion without \\ngiving ? \\n\\nTybalt. Mercutio, thou consort\\'st with Romeo, — \\n\\nMercutio. Consort ! what, dost thou make us minstrels ? \\n\\n\\n\\n68 ROMKO AND JULIET. \\n\\nan thou make minstrels of ns, look to hear nothing but \\ndiscords : liere\\'s my fiddlestick ; here\\'s that shall make \\nyou dance. Zounds, consort ! \\n\\nBenvollo. We talk here in the public haunt of men. \\nEither withdraw unto some private place, \\nOr reason coldly of your grievances, \\nOr else depart ; here all eyes gaze on ns. \\n\\nMercutlo. Men\\'s eyes were made to look, and let them \\ngaze ; \\nI will not budge for no man\\'s pleasure, I. \\n\\nEntei\\' RoMKO. \\n\\nTyhalt. Well, peace be with you, sir; here comes my \\nman. \\n\\nMercutlo. \\'\\\\^\\\\\\\\t I\\'ll be hang\\'d, sir, if he wear your livery. \\nMarry, go before to field, he\\'ll be your follower ; \\nYour worship in that sense may call him man. \\n■ Tybalt. Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford \\nNo better term than this, — thou art a villain. \\n\\nRomeo. Tybalt, the reason that I hav^e to love thee \\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage \\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none ; \\nTherefore farewell : I see thou know\\'st me not. \\n\\nTi/halt.

Good king of cats, nothing but one of your \\nnine lives ; that I mean to make bold withal, and, as you \\nshall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the eight. \\nWill you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ? \\nmake haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out. \\n\\nTybalt.

I am \\npeppered, I warrant, for this world. — A plague o\\' both \\nyour houses! — Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to \\nscratch a man to death ! a braggart, a rogue, a villain, \\nthat fights by the book of arithmetic! — Why the devil \\ncame you between us ? I was hurt under your arm. \\n\\nRomeo. I thought all for the best. \\n\\nMercutio.

Benvolio, who began this bloody fray ? \\n\\nBenvolio. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo\\'s hand did \\nslay ; \\nRomeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink \\nHoAv nice the quarrel was, and urg\\'d withal \\nYour high displeasure : all this, uttered \\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow\\'d. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n/^ \\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Byron \\n\\n\\n\\nBOMEO AND JULIET. 73 \\n\\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen \\n\\nOf Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts \\n\\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio\\'s breast. \\n\\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, \\n\\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats \\n\\nCold death aside, and with the other sends \\n\\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity \\n\\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, \\n\\n\\' Hold, friends ! friends, part ! \\' and swifter than his tongue, \\n\\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points. \\n\\nAnd \\'twixt them rushes ; underneath whose arm \\n\\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life \\n\\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled ; \\n\\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo, \\n\\nWho had but newly entertain\\'d revenge, \\n\\nAnd to\\'t they go like lightning, for, ere I \\n\\nCould draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain. \\n\\nAnd, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. \\n\\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die. \\n\\nLady Capulet. He is a kinsman to the Montague ; \\nAffection makes him false, he speaks not true : \\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife. \\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life. \\nI beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give ; \\nRomeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live. \\n\\nPrince. Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio ; \\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe ? \\n\\n\\n\\n74 EOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nMontague. Not Komeo, prince, he was Mercutio\\'s \\nfriend ; \\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end, \\nThe life of Tybalt. \\n\\nPrince. And for that offence \\n\\nImmediately we do exile him hence. \\nI have an interest in your hate\\'s proceeding, \\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding ; \\nBut I\\'ll amerce you with so strong a fine \\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine. \\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses ; \\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses : \\nTherefore use none ; let Romeo hence in haste, \\nElse, when he\\'s found, that hour is his last. \\nBear hence this body and attend our will ; \\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\_Exeunt. \\n\\n\\n\\nScene II.

Even so lies she, \\n\\nBlubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering. — \\nStand up, stand up ; stand, an you be a man : \\nFor Juliet\\'s sake, for her sake, rise and stand. \\nWhy should you fall into so deep an ? \\n\\nRomeo.

Spak\\'st thou of Juliet ? hoAV is it with her ? \\nDoth she not think me an old murderer, \\nNow I have stain\\'d the childhood of our joy \\nWith blood remov\\'d but little from her own ? \\nWhere is she ? and how doth she ? and what says \\nMy conceal\\'d lady to our cancell\\'d love ? \\n\\nNui\\'se. 0, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps ; \\nAnd now falls on her bed ; and then starts up, \\nAnd Tybalt calls ; and then on Eomeo cries, \\nAnd then down falls again. \\n\\nRomeo. As if that name, \\n\\nShot from the deadly level of a gun, \\nDid murder her ; as that name\\'s cursed hand \\nMurdered her kinsman. — 0, tell me, friar, tell me. \\nIn what vile part of this anatomy \\nDoth my name lodge ? tell me, that I may sack \\nThe hateful mansion. \\\\_Draioin(j his sivord. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Hold thy desperate hand ! \\n\\nArt thou a man ? thy form cries out thou art : \\nThy tears are womanish ; thy wild acts denote \\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast : \\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man ! \\nOr ill-beseeming beast in seeming both ! \\nThou hast amaz\\'d me ; by my holy order, \\nI thought thy disposition better temper\\'d. \\nHast thou slain Tybalt ? wilt thou slay thyself ? \\n\\n\\n\\n86 \\n\\n\\n\\nBOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd slay thy lady too tliat lives in tliee, \\n\\nBy doing damned hate npon thyself ? \\n\\nWhy rail\\'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth ? \\n\\nSince birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet \\n\\nIn thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose. \\n\\nFie, fie, thou sham\\'st thy shape, thy love, thy wit, \\n\\nWhich, like a usurer, abound\\'st in all, \\n\\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed \\n\\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit. \\n\\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax, \\n\\nDigressing from the valor of a man ; \\n\\nThy dear love sworn, but hollow perjury. \\n\\nKilling that love which thou hast vow\\'d to cherish ; \\n\\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love. \\n\\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both. \\n\\nLike powder in a skilless soldier\\'s flask, \\n\\nIs set a-fire by thine own ignorance. \\n\\nAnd thou dismember\\' d with thine own defence. \\n\\nWhat, rouse thee, man ! thy Juliet is alive, \\n\\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead ; \\n\\nThere art thou happy : Tybalt would kill thee, \\n\\nBut thou slew\\'st Tybalt ; there art thou happy too : \\n\\nThe law that threaten\\'d death becomes thy friend \\n\\nAnd turns it to exile ; there art thou happy : \\n\\nA pack of blessings lights upon thy back ; \\n\\nHappiness courts thee in her best array ; \\n\\nBut like a misbehav\\'d and sullen wench. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 87 \\n\\nThou pout\\'st upon thy fortune and thy love. \\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable. \\nGo, get thee to thy love, as was decreed. \\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her : \\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set, \\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua ; \\nWhere thou shalt live, till we can find a time \\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends, \\nBeg pardon of the prince, and call thee back \\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy \\nThan thou went\\'st forth in lamentation. — \\nGo before, nurse ; commend me to thy lady, \\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed, \\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto : \\nEomeo is coming. \\n\\nNurse. Lord, I could have stay\\'d here all the night \\nTo hear good counsel ; O, what learning is ! — \\nMy lord, I\\'ll tell my lady you will come. \\n\\nRomeo. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. \\n\\nNurse. Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir ; \\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late. [_Exit. \\n\\nRomeo. How well my comfort is reviv\\'d by this ! \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Go hence ; good night ; and here \\nstands all your state : \\nEither be gone before the watch be set, \\nOr by the break of day disguis\\'d from hence. \\nSojourn in Mantua ; I\\'ll find out your man, \\n\\n\\n\\n88 BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nAnd lie shall signify from time to time \\n\\nEvery good hap to you that chances here. \\n\\nGive me thy hand ; \\'tis late : farewell ; good night. \\n\\nRomeo.

Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily, \\nThat we have had no time to move our daughter. \\nLook you, she lov\\'d her kinsman Tybalt dearly, \\nAnd so did I. — Well, we were born to die. — \\n\\'Tis very late, she\\'ll not come down to-night ; \\nI promise you, but for your company, \\nI would have been a-bed an hour ago. \\n\\nParis. These times of woe afford no time to woo. \\nMadam, good night ; commend nie to your daughter. \\n\\nLady Capulet. I will, and know her mind early to- \\nmorrow ; \\nTo-night she\\'s mew\\'d up to her heaviness. \\n\\nCapulet. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender \\nOf my child\\'s love : I think she will be rul\\'d \\nIn all respects by me ; nay, more, I doubt it not. — \\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed ; \\nAcquaint her here of my son Paris\\' love. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. go \\n\\nAnd bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next — \\nBut, soft ! what day is this ? \\n\\n-^^\"\\'^\"*- Monday, my lord. \\n\\nCapidet Monday ! ha, ha !

But what say you to Thursday ? \\nParis. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow. \\nCapulet. Well, get you gone ; o\\' Thursday be it then. \\nGo you to Juliet ere you go to bed. \\nPrepare her, wife, against this wedding-day. — \\nFarewell, my lord. — Light to my chamber, ho ! \\nAfore me, it is so very late, that we \\nMay call it early by and by. - Good night. \\\\_Exeunt. \\n\\nScene V.

Wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day : \\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark, \\n\\n\\n\\n90 BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nThat pierc\\'d tlie fearful hollow of thine ear ; \\nNightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree. \\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale. \\n\\nBorneo. It was the lark, the herald of the morn, \\nNo nightingale ; look, love, what envious streaks \\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east. \\nNight\\'s candies are burnt out, and jocund day \\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. \\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die. \\n\\nJuliet. Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I ; \\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhales. \\nTo be to thee this night a torch-bearer. \\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua : \\nTherefore stay yet, thou need\\'st not to be gone. \\n\\nBorneo. Let me be ta\\'en, let me be put to death ; \\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so. \\nI\\'ll say yon gray is not the morning\\'s eye, \\n\\'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia\\'s brow ; \\nNor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat \\nThe vaiilty heaven so high above our heads. \\nI have more care to stay than will to go ; \\nCome, death, and welcome ! Juliet wills it so. \\nHow is\\'t, my soul ? let\\'s talk, it is not day. \\n\\nJuliet. It is, it is ; hie hence, be gone, away ! \\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune. \\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps. \\nSome say the lark makes sweet division ; \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 9^ \\n\\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us. \\nSome say the lark and loathed toad change eyes ; \\n0, now I Avould they had chang\\'d voices too ! \\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray, \\nHunting thee hence with hunt\\'s-np to the day. \\nO, now be gone ; more light and light it grows. \\n\\nBorneo. More light and light ? — More dark and dark \\nour woes ! \\n\\nEnter Nurse. \\n\\nNurse. Madam ! \\n\\nJuliet. iSTurse ! \\n\\nNurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber. \\nThe day is broke ; be wary, look about. lExit. \\n\\nJuliet. Then, window, let day in, and let life out. \\n\\nRovieo. Farewell, farewell ! one kiss, and I\\'ll descend. \\n\\n[^Rovieo descends. \\n\\nJuliet. Art thou gone so ? my lord, my love, my friend ! \\nI must hear from thee every day in the hour, \\nFor in a minute there are many days ; \\nO, by this count I shall be much in years \\nEre T again behold my Eomeo ! \\n\\nRomeo. Farewell ! I will omit no opportunity \\nThat may convey my greetings, love, to thee. \\n\\nJuliet. 0, think\\'st thou we shall ever meet again ? \\n\\nRomeo. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve \\nFor sweet discourses in our time to come. \\n\\n\\n\\n92 EOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nJuliet. God, I have an ill-divining soul ! \\n]\\\\rethinks I see thee, now thou art below, \\nAs one dead in the bottom of a tomb ; \\nEither my eyesight fails, or thou look\\'st pale. \\n\\nBorneo. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you; \\nDry sorroAV drinks our blood. Adiei;, adieu ! \\\\_Exlt. \\n\\nJuliet. fortune, fortune ! all men call thee tickle ; \\nIf thou art fickle, what dost thou Avith him. \\nThat is renown\\'d for faith ? Be fickle, fortune ; \\nFor then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long, \\nBut send him back. \\n\\nLady Capulet. \\\\_Within\\'\\\\ Ho, daughter! are you up ? \\n\\nJuliet. Who is\\'t that calls ? is it my lady mother ? \\nIs she not down so late, or up so early ? \\nWhat unaccustom\\'d cause procures her hither ? \\n\\nEnter Lady Capulet. \\n\\nLachj Capulet. Why, how now, Juliet ! \\n\\nJuliet. Madam, I am not well. \\n\\nLady Capidet. Evermore weeping for your cousin\\'s \\ndeath? \\nWhat, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ? \\nAn if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live ; \\nTherefore, have done : some grief shows much of love, \\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit. \\n\\nJuliet. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 93 \\n\\nLadf/ Capulet. So shall you feel the loss, but not the \\nfriend \\nWhich you weep for. \\n\\nJuliet. Feeling so the loss, \\n\\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend. \\n\\nLady Capulet. Well, girl, thou weep\\'st not so much \\nfor his death \\nAs that the villain lives which slaughter\\'d him. \\nJuliet. What villain, madam ? \\n\\nLady Capulet. That same villain, Eomeo. \\n\\nJuliet. Villain and he be many miles asunder. — \\nGod pardon him ! I do, with all my heart ; \\nAnd yet no man like he doth grieve my heart. \\n\\nLady Capulet. That is, because the traitor murderer \\n\\nlives. \\nJuliet. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. \\nWould none but I might venge my cousin\\'s death ! \\nLady Capulet. We will have vengeance for it, fear \\nthou not ; \\nThen weep no more. I\\'ll send to one in Mantua, \\nWhere that same banish\\'d runagate doth live, \\nShall give him such an unaccustom\\'d dram, \\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company ; \\nAnd then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied. \\n\\nJuliet. Indeed, I never shall be satisfied \\nWith Eomeo, till I behold him — dead — \\nIs my poor heart so for a kinsman vex\\'d. — \\n\\n\\n\\n94 BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nMadam, if you could find out but a man \\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it, \\nThat Romeo should, upon receipt thereof. \\nSoon sleep in quiet. 0, how my heart abhors \\nTo hear him nam\\'d, and cannot come to him, \\nTo wreak the love I bore my cousin \\nUpon his body that hath slaughter\\'d him ! \\n\\nLacli/ Capulet. Find thou the means, and I\\'ll find such \\na man. \\nBut now I\\'ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl. \\n\\nJuliet. And joy comes well in such a needy time. \\nWhat are they, I beseech your ladyship? \\n\\nLady Capulet. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, \\nchild; \\nOne who, to put thee from thy heaviness, \\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy, \\nThat thou expect\\'st not, nor I look\\'d not for. \\n\\nJxdiet. Madam, in happy time, what day is that ? \\n\\nLady Cajjulet. Marry, my child, early next Thursday \\nmorn. \\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman, \\nThe County Paris, at Saint Peter\\'s Church, \\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride. \\n\\nJuliet. Now, by Saint\\'s Peter Church and Peter too, \\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride. \\nI Avonder at this haste ; that I must wed \\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 95 \\n\\nI pray you, tell my lord and father, madam, \\nI will not marry yet ; and, when I do, I swear, \\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate. \\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed ! \\n\\nLady Capulet. Here comes your father ; tell him so \\nyourself, \\nAnd see how he will take it at your hands. \\n\\nEnter Capulet and Nurse. \\n\\nCapulet. When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew ; \\nBut for the sunset of my brother\\'s son \\nIt rains downright. — \\n\\nHow now ! a conduit, girl ? what, still in tears ? \\nEvermore showering ? In one little body \\nThou counterfeit\\'st a bark, a sea, a wind : \\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, \\nDo ebb and flow with tears ; the bark thy body is, \\nSailing in this salt flood ; the winds, thy sighs ; \\nWho, raging with thy tears, and they with them, \\nWithout a sudden calm, will overset \\nThy tempest-tossed body. — How now, wife ! \\nHave you deliver\\'d to her our decree ? \\n\\nLady Capulet. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives \\nyou thanks. \\nI would the fool were married to her grave ! \\n\\nCapulet. Soft ! take me with you, take me with you, \\nwife. \\n\\n\\n\\n96 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nHow ! will she none ? doth she not give us thanks ? \\nIs she not proud ? doth she not count her blest, \\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought \\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ? \\n\\nJuliet. Not proud you have, but thankful that you \\nhave : \\nProud can I never be of what I hate ; \\nBut thankful even for hate that is meant love. \\n\\nCaindet. How now, how now, chop-logic ! What is \\nthis ? \\n\\' Proud \\' and \\' I thank you \\' and \\' I thank you not/ \\nAnd yet \\' not proud \\' ! Mistress minion, you. \\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, \\nP)ut fettle your fine joints \\'gainst Thursday next, \\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter\\'s Church, \\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither. \\nOut, you green-sickness carrion ! out, you baggage ! \\nYou tallow-face ! \\n\\nLady Capidet. Fie, fie ! what, are you mad ? \\n\\nJuliet. Good father, I beseech you on my knees. \\nHear me with patience but to speak a word. \\n\\nCapulet. Hang thee, young baggage ! disobedient \\nwretch ! \\nI tell thee what : get thee to church o\\' Thursday, \\nOr never after look me in the face. \\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me ; \\nMy lingers itch. — Wife, we scarce thought us blest \\n\\n\\n\\nBOMEO AND JULIET. 97 \\n\\nThat God liad lent us but this only child ; \\nBut now I see this one is one too much, \\nAnd that we have a curse in having her : \\nOut on her, hilding ! \\n\\nNurse.

Peace, you mumbling fool ! \\n\\nUtter your gravity o\\'er a gossip\\'s bowl ; \\nFor here we need it not. \\n\\nLady Capulet. You are too hot. \\n\\nCapulet. God\\'s bread ! it makes me mad : day, night, \\nlate, early, \\nAt home, abroad, alone, in company. \\nWaking or sleeping, still my care hath been \\nTo have her match\\'d ; and having now provided \\nA gentleman of noble parentage. \\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train\\' d, \\nStuff\\' d, as they say, with honorable parts, \\nProportion\\'d as one\\'s thought would wish a man, — \\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool, \\nA whining; mammet, in her fortune\\'s tender, \\n\\n\\n\\n98 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nTo answer \\' 111 not wed ; I cannot love, \\n\\nI am too yonng ; I pray you, pardon nie.\\' — \\n\\nBut, an you will not wed, I\\'ll pardon you ; \\n\\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me : \\n\\nLook to\\'t, think on\\'t, I do not use to jest. \\n\\nThursday is near ; lay hand on heart, advise. \\n\\nAn you be mine, I\\'ll give you to my friend ; \\n\\nAn you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, \\n\\nFor, by my soul, I\\'ll ne\\'er acknowledge thee, \\n\\nXor what is mine shall never do thee good. \\n\\nTrust to\\'t, bethink you; I\\'ll not be forsworn. lExlt. \\n\\nJuliet.

Faith, here \\'tis. Eomeo \\n\\nIs banished, and all the world to nothing, \\nThat he dares ne\\'er come back to challenge you ; \\nOr, if he do, it needs must be by stealth. \\nThen, since the case so stands as now it doth, \\nI think it best you married with the county. \\n0, he\\'s a lovely gentleman ! \\nRomeo\\'s a dishclout to him ; an eagle, madam, \\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye \\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart, \\nI think you are happy in this second match, \\nFor it excels your first; or if it did not. \\nYour first is dead, or \\'twere as good he were, \\nAs living here and you no use of him. \\n\\nJuliet. Speakest thou from thy heart ? \\n\\nNurse. And from my soul too ; \\n\\nOr else beshrew them both. \\n\\nJuliet. Amen ! \\n\\nNurse. What ? \\n\\nJuliet. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much. \\nGo in, and tell my lady I am gone, \\nHaving displeas\\'d my father, to Laurence\\' cell. \\nTo make confession and to be absolv\\'d. \\n\\nNurse.

Friar Laurences Cell. \\n\\nEnter Friar Laurence and Paris. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. On Thursday, sir ? the time is very \\n\\nshort. \\nFar\\'is. My father Capulet will have it so ; \\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. You say you do not know the lady\\'s \\nmind; \\nUneven is the course, I like it not. \\n\\nParis. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt\\'s death, \\nAnd therefore have I little talk\\'d of love ; \\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears. \\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous \\nThat she doth give her sorrow so much sway, \\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage, \\nTo stop the inundation of her tears. \\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone, \\nMay be put from her by society. \\nNow do you know the reason of this haste. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. [Aside\\'] I would I knew not why it \\nshould be slow\\'d. \\nLook, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell. \\n\\n101 \\n\\n\\n\\n102 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nEnter Juliet. \\n\\nParis. Happily met, my lady and m}^ wife ! \\n\\nJuliet. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife. \\n\\nParis. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next. \\n\\nJuliet. What must be shall be. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. That\\'s a certain text. \\n\\nParis. Come you to make confession to this father ? \\n\\nJuliet. To answer that, I should confess to you. \\n\\nParis. Do not deny to him that you love me. \\n\\nJuliet. I will confess to you that I love him. \\n\\nParis. So will you, I am sure, that you love me. \\n\\nJidiet. If I do so, it will be of more price. \\nBeing spoke behind your back, than to your face. \\n\\nParis. Poor soul, thy face is much abus\\'d with tears. \\n\\nJuliet. The tears have got small victory by that ; \\nFor it was bad enough before their spite. \\n\\nParis. Thou wrong\\'st it more than tears with tliat re- \\nport. \\n\\nJuliet. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth ; \\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face. \\n\\nParis. Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander\\'d it. \\n\\nJuliet. It may be so, for it is not mine own. — \\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now ; \\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass ? \\n\\nFriar Laurence. My leisure serves me, pensive daugh- \\ntei\\', now. — \\nMy lord, we mast entreat the time alone. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 103 \\n\\nParis. God shield I should disturb devotion ! — \\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye : \\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. [^Exit. \\n\\nJuliet. 0, shut the door ! and when thou hast done so, \\nCome weep with me ; past hope, past cure, past help ! \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief ; \\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits : \\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it, \\nOn Thursday next be married to this county. \\n\\nJuliet. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear\\'st of this, \\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it; \\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help, \\nDo thou but call my resolution wise. \\nAnd with this knife I\\'ll help it presently. \\nGod join\\'d my heart and Romeo\\'s, thou our hands ; \\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seai\\'d, \\nShall be the label to another deed. \\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt \\nTurn to another, this shall slay them botli : \\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc\\'d time, \\nGive me some present counsel, or, behold, \\n\\'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife \\nShall play the umpire, arbitrating that \\nWhich the commission of thy years and art \\nCould to no issue of true honor bring. \\nBe not so long to speak j I long to die, \\nIf what thou speak\\'st speak not of remedy. \\n\\n\\n\\n104 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Hold, daughter ! I do spy a kind of \\nhope, \\nWhich craves as desperate an execution \\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent. \\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris, \\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, \\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake \\nA thing like death to chide away this shame. \\nThat cop\\'st with death himself to scape from it ; \\nAnd if thou dar\\'st, I\\'ll give thee remedy. \\n\\nJuliet. 0, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris, \\nErom off the hattlements of yonder tower ; \\nOr walk in thievish ways ; or bid me lurk \\nWhere serpents are ; chain me with roaring bears ; \\nOr shut me nightly in a charnel-house, \\nO\\'ercover\\'d quite with dead men\\'s rattling bones, \\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls j \\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave \\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud ; \\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble ; \\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt, \\nTo live an unstain\\'d wife to my sweet love. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. Hold, then ; go home, be merry, give \\nconsent \\nTo marry Paris.

Then say at once what thou dost know in this. \\n\\nFriar Laurence. I will be brief, for my short date of \\nbreath \\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale. \\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; \\nAnd she, there dead, that Eomeo\\'s faithful wife. \\n\\n\\n\\n136 BOMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nI married them ; and their stolen marriage-day \\n\\nWas Tybalt\\'s doomsday, whose untimely death \\n\\nBanish\\'d the new-made bridegroom from this city, \\n\\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin\\'d. \\n\\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her, \\n\\nBetroth\\'d and would have married her perforce \\n\\nTo County Paris ; then comes she to me. \\n\\nAnd with wild looks bid me devise some means \\n\\nTo rid her from this second marriage. \\n\\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself. \\n\\nThen gave I her, so tutor\\'d by my art, \\n\\nA sleeping potion ; which so took effect \\n\\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her \\n\\nThe form of death : meantime I writ to Eomeo, \\n\\nThat he should hither come as this dire night, \\n\\nTo help to take her from her borrow\\'d grave, \\n\\nBeing the time the potion\\'s force should cease. \\n\\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John, \\n\\nWas stay\\'d by accident, and yesternight \\n\\nReturn\\'d my letter back. Then all alone. \\n\\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking. \\n\\nCame I to take her from her kindred\\'s vault, \\n\\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell \\n\\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo ; \\n\\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time \\n\\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay \\n\\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead. \\n\\n\\n\\nROMEO AND JULIET. 137 \\n\\nShe wakes, and I entreated her come forth, \\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience ; \\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb. \\nAnd she too desperate would not go with me, \\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself. \\nAll this I know ; and to the marriage \\nHer nurse is privy : and, if aught in this \\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life \\nBe sacrific\\'d some hour before his time \\nUnto the rigor of severest law. \\n\\nPrince. We still have known thee for a holy man. — \\nWhere\\'s Romeo\\'s man ? what can he say in this ? \\n\\nBalthasar. I brought my master news of Juliet\\'s \\ndeath, \\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua \\nTo this same place, to this same monument. \\nThis letter he early bid me give his father, \\nAnd threaten\\'d me with death, going in the vault, \\nIf I departed not and left him there. \\n\\nPrince. Give me the letter ; I will look on it. — \\nWhere is the county\\'s page that rais\\'d the watch ? — \\nSirrah, what made your master in this place ? \\n\\nPage. He came with flowers to strew his lady\\'s grave ; \\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did. \\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb, \\nAnd by and by my master drew on him ; \\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n138 ROMEO AND JULIET. \\n\\nPrince. This letter doth make good the friar\\'s words \\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death ; \\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison \\nOf a poor apothecary, and therewithal \\nCame to this vault to die and lie with Juliet. — \\nWhere be these enemies ? — Capulet ! — Montague ! \\nSee, what a scourge is laid upon your hate, \\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love ! \\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too. \\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen ; all are punish\\'d. \\n\\nCapulet. brother Montague, give me thy hand ; \\nThis is my daughter\\'s jointure, for no more \\nCan I demand. \\n\\nMontague. But I can give thee more ; \\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold. \\nThat while Verona by that name is known \\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set \\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet. \\n\\nCapulet. As rich shall Eomeo by his lady lie ; \\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity ! \\n\\nPrince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings ; \\n\\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head. \\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things ; \\n\\nSome shall be pardon\\'d, and some punished : \\nFor never was a story of more woe \\nThan this of Juliet and her Komeo. \\\\_Exeunt. \\n\\n\\n\\n-BAp\\'05 \\n\\n\\n\\n'"
